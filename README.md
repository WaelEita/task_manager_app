# Task Manager App

This Flutter project is a task manager application designed to help users efficiently manage their
tasks. The project focuses on implementing key features such as user authentication, task
management, state management, and local storage for data persistence.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine**: git
   clone https://github.com/WaelEita/task_manager_app.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**: cd C:\task_manager_app
3. **Install dependencies using Flutter**: Once you're inside the project directory, install the
   dependencies required for the project to run using the following command:flutter pub get
4. **Run the app on a connected device or emulator**: After installing the dependencies, you can run
   the app on either a connected physical device or an emulator using the following command:flutter
   run

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different sections to maintain clarity and separation of concerns:

- **View**: Contains the UI components and screens.
- **Bloc**: Manages the business logic and state of the application using the BLoC pattern.
- **Data**: Handles data sources, repositories, and API integration.
- **Utils**: Provides utility functions and helper classes for improved code maintainability.

## Features Implemented

- **User Authentication**: Allows users to securely log in with their credentials.
- **Task Management**: Enables users to view, add, edit, and delete tasks.
- **State Management**: Utilizes the BLoC pattern for efficient state management across the app.
- **Local Storage**: Persists tasks locally to ensure data availability even when the app is
  offline.

## Additional Features

While certain features such as pagination and unit tests were not implemented due to time
constraints, efforts were made to ensure a solid foundation for the app's functionality and
structure.

## Challenges Faced

The primary challenge during development was the tight deadline of 3 days, compounded by the
occurrence of the Eid holiday. Despite these constraints, the project maintains a high level of
organization and adherence to SOLID principles.
